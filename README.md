# Cornerstone Parser (Lab 2B)

A robust Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) generator built using **Flex** and **Bison**. This parser supports a C-like language with advanced features like function definitions, error recovery, and semantic validation.

## 🚀 Features
- **Core Grammar**: Supports variable declarations, initializers, assignments, `if-else` logic, and `while` loops.
- **Functions (Extension)**: Support for function definitions (`func`), `return` statements, and function calls within expressions.
- **Script Support (Extension)**: Capable of parsing multiple top-level statements in a single file (statement lists).
- **Error Recovery (Extension)**: Uses the `error` token to recover from syntax errors and continue parsing subsequent code without crashing.
- **Semantic Validation**: Enforces the "Declare-before-use" rule using a symbol table.
- **Comments**: Handles both single-line (`//`) and multi-line (`/* ... */`) comments.

## 🛠 Build Instructions

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have `flex`, `bison`, and `gcc` installed on your system.

### Compiling
Use the provided `Makefile` to generate the lexer, parser, and executable:

```bash
make clean
make

This will generate the executable named lab2b_parser.

How to Run
Running the Parser
To parse a source file and display the AST:

Bash

./lab2b_parser <path_to_source_file>
Example:

Bash

./lab2b_parser tests/valid/01_full_program.txt
🧪 Testing
Running Valid Tests
All files in tests/valid/ should pass both the syntax and semantic checks.

Bash

for f in tests/valid/*.txt; do 
    echo "Testing $f..."
    ./lab2b_parser "$f"
    echo "--------------------------"
done
Running Invalid Tests
Files in tests/invalid/ demonstrate the parser's ability to catch errors.

Syntax Errors: The parser will report the line number and attempt to recover at the next semicolon.

Semantic Errors: The program will report: SEMANTIC ERROR: Variable 'x' used before declaration.

Assumptions & Deviations
Variable Scoping: The current symbol table is implemented as a flat global table. This satisfies the requirement that a variable must be declared using var before any use (assignment or expression).

Function Arguments: Function definitions currently support zero parameters func name(). Function calls are supported as expressions and can accept one optional argument.

Error Recovery: The parser recovers at the statement level. If an error occurs within a statement, Bison discards tokens until it finds a semicolon ; and resumes parsing.

Dangling Else: The grammar handles the dangling else ambiguity by giving precedence to the closest if (standard C behavior). This results in 1 expected shift/reduce conflict.

Unary Operations: The unary minus (e.g., -5) is internally transformed into 0 - expression within the AST for simplified processing.

AST Node Structure
The AST uses a multi-child approach to represent the program structure:

left: Primary child, expression, or condition.

right: Secondary child or "then" block for if statements.

third: "else" block for if statements.

next: Sibling pointer used to link statements in a statement_list.
